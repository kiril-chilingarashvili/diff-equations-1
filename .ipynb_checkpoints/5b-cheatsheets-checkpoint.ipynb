    "### An ***autonomous*** ODE is a differential equation that does not explicitly depend on the independent variable. If time is the independent variable, this means that the ODE is time-invariant. We will use time as the independent variable in this lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The standard form for a first order autonomous equation is\n",
    "## $$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y) \\quad (\\text{instead of}\\, f(t, y)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### where the right hand side does not depend on $t$. As usual, we write $\\displaystyle \\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dt}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For example, the (nonlinear) equation\n",
    "## $$ \\dot{y} = y - 3 y^2 $$\n",

    "### is autonomous. We will find out later that this DE models population growth in an environment with limited resources. It is called a ***logistic equation***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Why is this called autonomous***? \n",
    "### In ordinary English, a machine or robot is called autonomous if it operates without human input. A differential equation is called autonomous if its coefficients are not changed over time, such as might happen if a human adjusted a dial on a machine and let it run."

For autonomous equations, the qualitative behaviour of all solutions is encoded by the critical points and the signs of $f(y)$ in the intervals between the critical points.\n",
