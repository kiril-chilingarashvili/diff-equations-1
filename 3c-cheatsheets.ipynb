    "### Consider this ideal spring system involving two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$ connected by 3 springs with spring constants $k_1, k_2$ and $k_3$ respectively. Let $x_1$ be the displacement of the mass $m_1$ away from the equilibrium position. Similarly, let $x_2$ be the displacement of the mass $m_2$ away from equilibrium. The case $x_1=x_2=0$ corresponds to the situation where neither mass is displaced from its equilibrium position.\n",

    "### ***The differential equations***:\n",

    "### ***Answer***:\n",
    "### Use characteristic polynomials in the same way as we did to solve second order ODEs with constant coefficients. The characteristic polynomial of the DE above is of 4th order. It has 4 (possibly complex) roots counted with multiplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For second order linear homogeneous ODEs, we need 2 linearly independent solutions corresponding to the 2 characteristic roots. For an $n^{\\text{th}}$ order linear ODE, we need $n$ linearly independent solutions. What does linear independence mean for a set of $n$ functions? Linear independence of $n$ functions is a much more sophisticated notion than linear independence of $2$ functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our first task in this lecture is to discuss carefully what we mean by linear independence and to define dimension. These ideas are essential to describing solutions to higher order ODEs."

    "### ***Example 4.1***\n",
    "### The 2-dimensional $(x,y)$-plane is a vector space. The vectors are the ordered pairs $(x,y)$ that add component-wise: $(x_1,y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2)$.\n",
    "### There is a zero element $(0, 0)$ and you can scale vectors by real numbers: $a(x, y) = (ax, ay)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### ***Definition 4.2***\n",
    "### Suppose that $S$ is a set of elements called ***vectors*** equipped with two laws: a law for adding vectors in $S$ called ***vector addition***, and a law for multiplying vectors in $S$ by real numbers, called ***scalar multiplication***. Then $S$ is a ***real vector space*** if all of the following are true:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. There is a ***zero vector*** in $S$: a vector $\\bf{0}$ in $S$ such that $\\bf{v}+\\bf{0} = \\bf{v}$ for every vector $\\bf{v}$ in $S$\n",
    "### 2. (Closed under scalar multiplication.) Multiplying any one vector in $S$ by a real number gives another vector in $S$: if $\\bf{v}$ is in $S$ and $a$ is a real number, then $a\\bf{v}$ is in $S$ too.\n",

    "### ***Example 4.3***\n",
    "### The set of all real-valued functions forms a real vector space. The constant $0$-function is the zero vector. Vector addition is addition of functions point-wise $(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$. Scalar multiplication is multiplying a function by a real number at each point, e.g. $-2f(x) = (-2)(f(x))$.\n",
