    "\n",
    "### An ***autonomous*** ODE is a differential equation that does not explicitly depend on the independent variable. If time is the independent variable, this means that the ODE is time-invariant. We will use time as the independent variable in this lecture.\n",

    "### The standard form for a first order autonomous equation is\n",
    "## $$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y) \\quad (\\text{instead of}\\, f(t, y)) $$\n",

    "### where the right hand side does not depend on $t$. As usual, we write $\\displaystyle \\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dt}$.\n",

Let the top branch of the parabola be called $y_{\\text{top}}(h)$. Then for each value of $\\displaystyle h < \\frac{9}{4}, y(t) \\to y_{\\text{top}}(h)$ as $t$ increases.\n",

    "### Harvesting at exactly the maximum rate is a little dangerous, however, because if after a while $y$ becomes very close to $\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{2}$, and a little kid comes along and takes a few more frogs out of the pond so that the population is just below $\\displaystyle \\frac{3}{2}$, the whole frog population will crash!"

    "### Observe that the direction fields are independent of time. This is the most important property of autonomous equations, and it is exactly for this reason that the phase line is able to capture qualitatively the behavior of all solution curves. A phase line makes sense only if the DE is autonomous!"
