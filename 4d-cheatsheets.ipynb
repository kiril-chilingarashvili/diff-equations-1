    "### 1. ***Draw a diagram of the system***. We've already done Step 1!\n",

    "### Next, to understand the diagram above, we need to define an orientation of the circuit; say that current flows clockwise. Since it's a series circuit, the current through any of the wires is the same; write $I(t)$ for it. Then we can say that the power source, at left, produces a voltage ***increase*** of $V(t)$ volts at time $t$. This voltage increase may vary with time, and may be negative as well as positive. In fact we'll be especially interested in the case in which it is sinusoidal!\n",

For system response, we are interested in the loudness of the speaker, which is proportional to the voltage drop across the resistor. So we declare $V_R$ to be the system response.\n",
