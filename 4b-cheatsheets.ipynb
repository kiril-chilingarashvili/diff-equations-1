    "### Suppose we are studying the tides in Boston Harbor. Let $x$ be the water level in Boston Harbor. Let $y$ be the water level of the ocean. Then the input is the ocean level $y$, which is responsible for the changing tides $x$ in Boston Harbor, the system response.\n",

    "### We assume that the ocean and the harbor are connected by a narrow channel so that the flow is slow and not turbulent. This allows us to assume that the flow rate is pressure driven, and is linearly proportional to the pressure difference. Furthermore the pressure difference is linearly proportional to the difference in water level between the ocean and the harbor."
