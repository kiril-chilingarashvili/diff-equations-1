    "### We have been studying LTI, or Linear Time-Invariant systems. “Time-invariant\" means that the system parameters are not changing, or are changing very slowly relative to the time scale we are interested in. \n",
    "### The implication for our input/output analysis is this: If $x(t)$ is a system response to the input signal $f(t)$, then if we delay the input signal by $t_0$ seconds, the output signal is the same as before but delayed by $t_0$ seconds as well: $x(t-t_0)$ is a system response to the input $f(t-t_0)$. The system parameters are the coefficients in the differential equation; so “time-invariant\" is the same as “constant coefficient.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Because our systems are also ***linear***, if $x(t)$ is a system response to $f(t)$, then $Ax(t)$ is a system response to $Af(t)$. Thus when studying a linear time-invariant system with sinusoidal input $A\\cos(\\omega t - \\phi))$, it is enough to consider the input $\\cos(\\omega t)$ since linearity and time-invariance give the response to all other sinusoidal inputs for free.\n",
