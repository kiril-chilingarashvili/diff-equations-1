The only way to interpret “$8$\" in “$D8$\" is as a ***constant*** function, which of course has derivative zero: $D8 = 0$. The point is that in order to know the function $Df(t)$ at a particular value of $t$, say $t=a$, you need to know more than just $f(a)$; you need to know how $f(t)$ is changing near $a$ as well. This is characteristic of operators; in general you have to expect to need to know the ***whole*** function $f(t)$ in order to evaluate an operator on it.\n",
